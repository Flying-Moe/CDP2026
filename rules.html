<p>
  Welcome to the <strong>Cup of Death</strong>.  
  This game is played for fun. No vigilante work of any kind.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Each participant must submit a list of <strong>20 celebrities</strong>
    they believe will die during the year 2026.
    Lists must be submitted no later than <strong>December 29th, 2025</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    A celebrity is defined as a person who is widely known.
    In case of doubt, the final decision lies with the <strong>Grim Reaper</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    A death is only considered valid when confirmed by
    <strong>at least two trustworthy news sources</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Points are awarded based on the age of the celebrity at the time of death,
    calculated as:
    <br />
    <strong>100 − age = points</strong>
    <br />
    Any celebrity aged <strong>99 or older</strong> is worth
    a minimum of <strong>1 point</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    When one of your picks dies, you have <strong>7 days</strong> from the time
    of death to submit a replacement.
    After 7 days, the right to replace that pick expires.
  </li>

  <li>
    The game officially starts on <strong>January 1st, 2026</strong>.
    Deaths before this date do not count.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>July is sweep month.</strong>
    For an additional fee of <strong>15€</strong>, a player may replace
    their <strong>entire list</strong>.
    The new list must be completely original and contain
    <strong>no names from the original list</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Scores and standings will be published at least
    <strong>once per month</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    The Grim Reaper’s office has the final say in all matters.
