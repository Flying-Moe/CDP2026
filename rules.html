    <strong>First Blood</strong><br />
    First confirmed death of the season.
  </p>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>
    Each contestant shall submit a list containing <strong>20 celebrity names</strong>
    they think will die before the end of 2026.
    You must submit their full names by <strong>December 29th, 2025</strong> at the latest.
    Submissions will be sent to: <strong>hreskesenlt@hotmail.com</strong>
  </li>

  <li>
    A celebrity, for the purpose of the dead pool, is defined as any person who is widely known.
    Should there be doubt whether or not the person is a celebrity,
    the final decision lies with the <strong>Grim Reaper</strong> (Game Master).
    A death must be confirmed in <strong>at least two trustworthy news media</strong>
    before it is accepted.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>The point system:</strong><br />
    Points will be awarded for each celebrity who dies in 2026.
    The points awarded will be calculated by the person's age at the time of their death.
    The calculation is as follows: <strong>100 − age = points</strong>.
    Therefore, the younger your pick, the more potential points
    (example: Liam from One Direction died at the age of 31; 100 − 31 = 69 points).
  </li>

  <li>
    Any celebrity aged <strong>99 and over</strong> is worth <strong>1 point</strong>.
    Ages will be based on the published age at the time of death,
    as reported by the media.
  </li>

  <li>
    The burden of proof is upon the contestants.
    Notify the <strong>Grim Reaper</strong> when one of your celebrities has bitten the dust.
  </li>

  <li>
    Should one of your celebrity picks die during the game,
    you have <strong>7 days</strong> from the time of death
    to make a new pick for your list and send it to the Grim Reaper.
    After 7 days, the right to pick fresh meat for your list expires.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Start Date:</strong>
    This Dead Pool officially begins on <strong>January 1st, 2026</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Any questions, conflicts, problems, decisions, or arbitrary assessments
    will be made by the <strong>Grim Reaper’s office</strong>,
    and their decisions are final.
    Whining or other forms of complaining will result in <strong>-1 point</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>July is sweep month.</strong>
    This means that you can switch your whole death list
    for an additional <strong>15 euro</strong>.
    Your whole list must be brand new.
    No copies from your first picks.
  </li>

  <li>
    The scores and standings will be sent out
    <strong>at least once a month</strong>.
  </li>
</ol>
